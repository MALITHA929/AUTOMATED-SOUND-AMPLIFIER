# 📢 Automated Sound Amplifier
Semester_02 project


The Automated Sound Amplifier is a standalone system that automatically maintains consistent audio levels in real time. It monitors the output of an existing amplifier, analyzes sound levels, and dynamically adjusts gain to ensure clear and balanced audio for different speakers.

Designed for lectures, meetings, and small events, the system integrates seamlessly with existing audio setups without requiring modifications. It also supports customizable calibration to adapt to different acoustic environments.
